#### Registration Page:

Once clicking the registration page button on the landing page, you come to this screen. 

Here, the new user has three options: 

 1. Go to the sign in page in the case they forgot they have an account, 
 2. Fill out the sign up form which requires a name, email, and strong password, and 
 3. Go back to the landing page. 

The password has to be strong in the sense that it has to have at least 8 characters, 1 uppercase character, 1 number, and 1 special character.

#### Sign in Page:
